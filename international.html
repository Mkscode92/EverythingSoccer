      <p class="w3-large">International soccer refers to the professional and organized structure of national soccer teams that compete at various tournaments worldwide. These clubs are independent entities, which represent their country. For example a club team would be "Barcelona FC" while a national team would be "Argentina FC". Instead of being contracted to the club, players are called up to the team's squad by the manager. It is an immense honor to be called up. They do not compete in season long leagues like club soccer, but instead compete in tournaments and qualifiers that happen every so often. Each club has its own management, coaching staff, and infrastructure. They do not sign players, and players are not from different nationalities. Every player for a national team must have the same nationality.</p>

      <h1 style = "text-decoration: underline;">Tournament Qualifiers</h1>
      <p class="w3-large">Tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and continental championships such as the UEFA European Championship and the Copa America have intense qualifying rounds. These teams are assigned to a group out of multiple groups in their respective tournament that they are attempting to qualify for. They go against one another in their group in a series of matches to secure a spot in the final tournament. They follow the same point style of league games, where a win is 3 points, a draw is 1 point, and a loss is 0 points. In the european qualifiers for example, the two teams with the most points in each group qualify for the Euros. The drama and passion in these qualifiers often make for some unforgettable moments, as nations fight for the chance to represent their country on the world stage. The stakes are high, and every match brings its own suspense and thrill.</p>
